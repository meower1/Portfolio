                    <p>
                        Before getting into college I had some background of C# which i've mainly learned to be able to create game cheating software
                        and i ended up building a few simple modules
                        but due python being taught in uni I decided to switch to it and now its my most used language :)
                        <br><br>

                        My first python program was a script written to automate the setup of a personal proxy on my linux server
                        after that I've learned bash and automated most of my repetitive setup tasks on my servers and i still use some of the scripts up to
                        this day.
                        <br><br>
                        Other than that I've used python for my fastapi internship and i've entered a few coding competition which in one of them our team won!.
                        I've recently been getting into backend development and hoping to start a career as a backend developer

                    <hr>
                    <p>My first backend developement experience was in my internship, it provided a fantastic opportunity for me to gain
                        a decent understanding on api developement. In my internship i've managed to build a prototype university management system through
                        the fastapi framework

                        PS: I'm new to Django and am expanding my knowledge of backend developement field everyday!

                    <h5>How I Learn</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I often learn by building something that i find useful
                        If im learning a new language or concept i need to build something
                        which fits my logic of it having a purpose and get the grasp of how the language works in that manner.
                        My main resource of learning is coursera & w3schools and ofc the official documentations of whatever im learning.

                    <p>
                        I'm currently studying my way through backend developement and
                        am hoping to be able to secure a job as soon as possible. 
                        My main priority is building clean, functional and actually useful
                        software and enjoy the proccess of making it. I'm hoping to be able to
                        have enough spare time and motivation to contribute to opensource as much as possible
